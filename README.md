# MTSvieweR
Welcome to MTSviewer, a database for the study of mitochondrial proteins which integrates AlphaFold stuctures, cleavage predictions, N-terminomics, and genetic variants.  

## Features
- MTS predictions
- MPP cleavage sites
- Genetic variants
- Pathogenicity predictions
- N-terminomics data
- Structural visualization using AlphaFold models

It is accessible via [https://neurobioinfo.github.io/MTSvieweR](https://neurobioinfo.github.io/MTSvieweR)

[All of the raw data and in-house Python scripts used in the MTSviewer build are accessible and free to download.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L32pcbeUH-WR8ZTU4xTFvDV0XxG1WPbr?usp=sharing).

**Please note: if users wish to download the GitHub repository to run MTSviewer offline, they must unzip "AllPDBs.zip" within MTSViewer/Outputs/PDBs/ and replace all of the corresponding files in order to circumvent the GitHub directory limit of 1,000 files per directory. PDB structures will be missing from the offline version if users do not do this.**
